## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

1. **Set up your Kaggle environment:**
   - Create a new notebook with GPU/TPU acceleration enabled.

2. **Install required libraries:**
   ```python
   !pip install -U bitsandbytes transformers peft accelerate trl datasets
   ```

3. **Load the model and dataset:**
   ```python
   from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
   from datasets import load_dataset

   model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("/kaggle/input/gemma/transformers/7b-it/2")
   tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("/kaggle/input/gemma/transformers/7b-it/2")
   dataset = load_dataset("hieunguyenminh/roleplay", split="train[0:1000]")
   ```

4. **Configure 4-bit quantization and LoRA:**
   ```python
   from transformers import BitsAndBytesConfig
   from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model

   bnb_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(load_in_4bit=True, bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4")
   model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("/kaggle/input/gemma/transformers/7b-it/2", quantization_config=bnb_config)

   peft_config = LoraConfig(r=64, lora_alpha=16, target_modules=['q_proj', 'v_proj'], bias="none", task_type="CAUSAL_LM")
   model = get_peft_model(model, peft_config)
   ```

5. **Set up and start training:**
   ```python
   from transformers import TrainingArguments
   from trl import SFTTrainer

   training_args = TrainingArguments(output_dir="./gemma-7b-roleplay", num_train_epochs=1, per_device_train_batch_size=4)
   trainer = SFTTrainer(model=model, args=training_args, train_dataset=dataset, tokenizer=tokenizer)
   trainer.train()
   ```

6. **Generate responses:**
   ```python
   prompt = "Character: Sherlock Holmes\nUser: What's your method for solving cases?"
   inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
   outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=200)
   print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))
   ```
